# CS236

Most of this code was built proudly for a project a Brigham Young University. 
Should any other BYU student copy parts or all of this source code for a similar project, the software the CS dept uses to catch cheaters will likely catch you. 
So don't be that guy.

## RelationalDBA

The Relational Database is the final project built. The others were iterations to initally build a parser and scanner, and a datalog program for storing and querying a database. 

The Relational Database employs a Graph algorithm to assist in the speed of run-time calculations of various tuples. Impimentation included making adjacency lists, doing Depth First Searches, and breaking apart evaluation of database tuples in optimized order.
